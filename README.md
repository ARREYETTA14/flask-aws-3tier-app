In today's digital landscape, web applications are essential for delivering interactive and dynamic user experiences. To ensure scalability, security, and efficient management of resources, a robust architecture is necessary. One popular architecture is the 3-tier architecture, which divides the application into three distinct layers: the Presentation Tier, Logic Tier, and Data Tier. This separation allows for modular development, easier maintenance, and improved scalability.
